### 排查数据库执行慢
  show processlist
### 查询速度优化
  对常用条件创建索引
  减少执行sql语句的次数
  将关联查询操作移动到java代码中执行，当数据量大的时候减少在sql中执行IN 或 JOIN的操作

### 两表之间求差集（not in效率低，但绝对有效）
SELECT t1.* FROM t1 
WHERE name NOT IN
(SELECT name FROM t2)

SELECT t1.id, t1.name, t1.age
FROM t1 LEFT JOIN t2 ON t1.id = t2.id
WHERE t1.name != t2.name

### 优化left join代替not in
select uid from signshould where mid=897 
and uid not in(select uid from sign where mid=897 and thetype=0) 
and uid not in(select uid from leaves where mid=897)
                    ↓
select a.* from signshould as a 
LEFT JOIN (select * from sign where mid=897 and thetype=0) as b ON a.uid=b.uid 
LEFT JOIN (select * from leaves where mid=897) as c ON a.uid=c.uid  
where a.mid=897 and b.uid is null and c.uid is null
注：where后的条件容易错写成 a.uid != b.uid

### 联合查询表之间排序规则不同 Illegal mix of collations for operation 'UNION'
varchar等文本类型的字段使用了不同的排序规则，比如utf8_general_ci 与 utf8_unicode_ci 混用
