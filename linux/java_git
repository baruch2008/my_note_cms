原因
Cygwin uses persistent shared memory sections, which can on occasion become corrupted. The symptom of this is that some Cygwin programs begin to fail, but other applications are unaffected. Since these shared memory sections are persistent, often a reboot is needed to clear them out before the problem can be resolved.
解决方法（git\bin\目录下执行cmd）
rebase.exe -b 0x50000000 msys-1.0.dll
